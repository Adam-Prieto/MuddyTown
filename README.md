# MuddyTown
Muddy Town Project for CS 4050.


The purpose of this project is create a minimum spanning tree (MST) for a town that wants to pave roads connecting all buildings in 
the town to each other.

This program will read in information from a text file, process the file contents, and return a sorted list of the streets to be paved to 
produce the MST. The result should also be able to be exported to a .txt file (either the same file or a new one) and printed to the console.

Relevant algorithms to use in this program include, but are not limited to: quick sort, merge sort, bubble sort, prim's algorithm,
djikstra's algorithm, and kruskal's algorithm among others.
